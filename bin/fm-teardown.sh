# clear volatile state, refresh/prune the project's clone for PR-based ship
# tasks, then print a backlog-refresh reminder for ship and scout teardowns
# REFUSES if the worktree holds work that has not LANDED, because cleanup
# hard-resets/removes the worktree and kills its processes. Work has landed when it is
# reachable from any remote-tracking branch (a fork counts as a remote, so
# upstream-contribution PRs pushed to a fork satisfy this in any mode), OR - for a
# normal ship task whose commits are not so reachable - when its PR is merged and
# GitHub reports a PR head that contains the current local work, or its content is
# already present in the up-to-date default branch. This recognizes the common
# squash-merge-then-delete-branch flow, where the branch's own commits live nowhere
# on a remote yet the change is fully in main.
# The PR itself is resolved from the task's recorded pr= when present, or - when
# no pr= was ever recorded (e.g. a yolo-authorized merge on a repo with no PR CI,
# where the usual "checks green" fm-pr-check.sh trigger never fires) - by looking
# up a merged PR whose head branch matches the worktree's branch, fetching its head
# via refs/pull/<n>/head when the branch itself was deleted. So a missing pr= never
# by itself causes a false refusal of landed work.
# A gh lookup error falls back to the content check; if that is also inconclusive,
# teardown refuses rather than risk discarding unlanded work.
# Uncommitted changes are never landed.
# local-only projects additionally accept work merged into the local default
# branch (firstmate performs that merge after configured approval) as a fallback
# for the common case where there is no remote at all.
# Scout tasks (kind=scout in meta) carve out of that check: their worktree is
# declared scratch and the report at data/<task-id>/report.md is the work
# product. Teardown proceeds only once the report exists and the shared
# unresolved-decision completion gate verifies its captain-held inventory.
# Before destructive cleanup, teardown validates task check artifacts and any
# matching quarantine entries as ordinary single-link files on the state
# device. It refuses and preserves task state when that proof fails; otherwise
# it removes the task's check, trust record, PR sidecar, publication record, and
# quarantine entries with the rest of the volatile state.
# only the exact task pane from ordinary endpoint metadata and never calls
# `workspace close`. It retires the non-authoritative journal only when a
# read-only token correlation agrees with that endpoint and pane closure is
# confirmed. Otherwise the journal stays quarantined for manual inspection.
# Projected closes share the presentation-order lock, refuse to close the
# captain's active tab, and restore the exact response-derived pre-close tab
# teardown refuses while their home has in-flight crewmate meta files; --force
# is the approved discard path that prevalidates child removal targets, locks each
# descendant home's task set before enumeration, and holds those locks through
# child cleanup. Contention refuses the complete forced teardown before child
# mutation. Local and remote retirement serialize their destructive phase with
# state is retired with the home, and local removal failure restores that state
# before preserving the route for retry. Teardown then discards child work, kills
# child runtime endpoints, and removes the retired home. Removing a leased home
# releases its durable treehouse lease so the pool slot is freed,
# never left leased forever. If the treehouse return fails, teardown leaves the
# leased home and state in place instead of hiding a still-held lease.
# Usage: fm-teardown.sh <task-id> [--force]
#   --force skips ordinary-task dirty and landed-work checks, skips scout report
#   when the captain has explicitly said to discard the work.
#
# Transient / stale worktree git lock recovery (teardown-lock-race): a crew process
# killed mid-git-operation can leave a .git/worktrees/<wt>/index.lock (or, for a
# non-linked worktree, .git/index.lock) that makes `treehouse return --force` fail
# with Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists. That lock is usually transient
# (the dying process finishes or exits within seconds) and must never be force-deleted
# while a live git process might still own it - the fix is patience, not rm.
#
# On that failure signature only, teardown_treehouse_return:
#   1. Retries up to FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES times (default 3), waiting
#      FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS (default 1s; falls back to the older
#      FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS name when the new one is unset) between
#      attempts. Retries key off the error text, not whether the lock file still
#      exists after the failed attempt - a lock that self-clears mid-check still
#      deserves a retry of the return.
#   2. Other treehouse return failures still abort immediately and loudly (no retry).
#   3. If every retry still hits the lock signature and the lock remains, it is removed
#      and the return tried once more ONLY when the lock is provably stale per
#      bin/fm-lock-lib.sh's fm_lock_is_provably_stale, passing the worktree dir as the
#      companion directory and FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_AGE_SECS (default 30s) as the age
#      threshold. That shared proof owns the exact lsof-holder, mtime-age, and fail-safe
#      rules.
#   4. If retries exhaust and the lock is not provably stale, teardown fails as loudly
#      as a normal return failure and notes that the lock persisted across the retry
#      window. A missing `lsof`, or a lock that fails any stale check, is treated as
#      NOT provably stale (fail safe): the lock is left untouched.
# The same proof is used when non-force safety inspection cannot run because the lock
# is present; teardown clears only a provably stale lock, then re-runs the safety
# checks before any destructive return. Teardown output notes every wait, retry, and
# removal so the operator can see what happened.
#
# Pre-teardown cleanup sequence (runs once every landed/discard-work safety
# refusal above has already passed, and BEFORE any worktree return, branch
# delete, or backend kill below - a still-active run or a leaked process may
# own live work in that worktree):
#   Fix 1 - conclude the task's own no-mistakes run. A ship task's worktree can
#     be torn down while its no-mistakes pipeline run is still PARKED at a gate
#     (awaiting_approval/fix_review/any awaiting_agent field), with no worker
#     left to ever answer it - the run then sits there holding a fleet slot
#     indefinitely (observed 2026-08-03: runs parked 7h39m and parked at a
#     post-CI approval gate after the worker was already cleaned up). A run
#     with an autonomous step still under way (running/fixing/ci) is left
#     alone: no-mistakes drives those against its own gate-repo clone, not the
#     crew's worktree, so they are not orphaned by removing the worktree.
#     conclude_task_no_mistakes_run attributes the active-or-most-recent run to
#     THIS task only when its branch AND code identity (bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh's
#     fm_nm_head_matches_worktree, the same rule bin/fm-crew-state.sh uses) both
#     match this worktree, then runs `no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>` for
#     that verified run instance. A run already terminal
#     (an outcome is set) or not parked at a gate is left untouched. Idempotent:
#     an already-aborted run reads back terminal and is skipped on retry.
#   Fix 2 - reap leaked descendant processes. A backgrounded/disowned process
#     started under the worktree (or its per-task tasktmp) does not receive the
#     SIGHUP/SIGTERM that closing the backend pane sends to its own foreground
#     process group, so it survives reparented to init (observed 2026-08-03:
#     two `go test` binaries, deadlines blown past by ~100x, pinning CPU for
#     hours with no live task meta to attribute them to once teardown had
#     already removed it). reap_task_worktree_processes finds every process
#     whose CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY is this task's own worktree or tasktmp
#     root via `lsof -a -d cwd` (cheap: bounded by process count, not by
#     walking the worktree's file tree) and sends TERM, then KILL after a short
#     grace period to any survivor whose process identity still matches. Both
#     roots are unique per task and never
#     shared, so this can never reach another task's or the primary's
#     processes. Idempotent: nothing left to find is a silent no-op.
#   Fix 3 - sweep abandoned remote job workers. A remote job worker started
#     from a worktree's own bin/ outlives that worktree's removal without
#     being reachable by Fix 2, because its working directory is wherever it
#     was launched rather than the task worktree (observed 2026-08-07: 29
#     workers at ppid 1, 1-2 days old, each still polling and appending to a
#     owns that sweep and its safety rule; it never touches a worker whose code
#     root still exists, so the account's healthy LaunchAgent worker and every
#     failure never blocks this teardown.
