#          firstmate's own current default-branch commit, that update is a

#          fm_backend_agent_state: skipped distinguishes an existing ambiguous

#          A TANGLE line means the firstmate primary checkout (FM_ROOT) is stranded
#          on a feature branch instead of its default branch - a crewmate's work
#          landed in the primary instead of its own worktree; restore it per the line.
#          treehouse is also MISSING when its installed version lacks
#          "treehouse get --lease" support.
#          no-mistakes is also MISSING when its installed version is older than
#          1.31.2.
#          The AXI-family floor policy is owned beside GH_AXI_MIN and
#          LAVISH_AXI_MIN below; the per-tool owners point there. An installed
#          build below its floor reports MISSING like no-mistakes, so the operator
#          is asked to upgrade rather than silently running an older tool.
#          tasks-axi feature probes remain a separate defense-in-depth check.
#          tasks-axi and quota-axi are required bootstrap tools (same class as
#          lavish-axi). A compatible tasks-axi default backend is silent.
#          quota-axi is required for the agent-owned dispatch-profile array
#          procedure in AGENTS.md section 4 and
#          .agents/skills/quota-array-dispatch/SKILL.md.
#          On a primary home, the locked mutable path materializes the visible
#          default config/startup-memory-budget=7500 when absent. It never
#          await the primary-authoritative inherited value instead of creating
#          their own.
#          Fleet sync fetches, fast-forwards safe default-branch states, reports
#          recovered and STUCK clone drift, and prunes gone local branches; it is
#          bounded by FM_FLEET_SYNC_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT when it is a non-empty
#          numeric override, while non-numeric values fall back to 20s.
#          When the override is unset or blank, the timeout is
#          max(20, 5 + 3 * origin-backed project clone count). A timed-out
#          refresh relays any completed fm-fleet-sync.sh output before the
#          aggregate timeout skip line with timeout and elapsed seconds.
#          Set FM_FLEET_PRUNE=0 to skip branch pruning during that refresh.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 to skip the five MUTATING sweeps
#          printing every read-only detect line
#          above; the TANGLE line switches to advisory-only wording with no
#          checkout command. Used by
#          fm-session-start.sh's read-only path when another live session holds
#          the fleet lock, so a second concurrent session never race-mutates
#          project clones, or repair instructions.
#          Unset/0 (the default) runs all five sweeps - this flag is purely
#          additive.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_NETWORK to split this run by whether a step talks to
#          the network, so a session start can print its digest from local reads
#          alone and run the network half off the digest's blocking path:
#            all  (default, and any unrecognized value) - every local and network
#                 step. Unrecognized values fall back here on purpose: a typo
#                 must never silently skip a safety sweep.
#            skip - every LOCAL step, and none of the network ones. Skips
#            only - ONLY those network steps and nothing else. No tool detection,
#                 no version floors, no tangle check, and no PR-check
#                 migration: those already ran on the local pass.
#          FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY composes with it unchanged, so `only` plus
#          detect-only is the read-only `gh auth status` probe on its own.
#          bin/fm-startup-network.sh owns the deferral: it runs the `only` phase
#          in a detached bounded worker and publishes the result. This file stays
#          the single owner of every sweep, and the split changes only WHEN each
#          runs, never WHETHER. During the network phase, project clone refresh
#          remote convergence workers run concurrently, because convergence
#          consumes respawned ids. Worker output is captured separately and
#          replayed in spawn order; failure to create that private capture
#          directory selects the sequential fallback.
#          A relaunch that the liveness sweep performs during an `only` run is
#          always reported, because a digest composed before that run already
#          printed the superseded endpoint record.
#          Set FM_BOOTSTRAP_LOCKED=1 alongside it when the sweeps are skipped
#          because THIS session already ran them while holding the fleet lock,
#          rather than because it has no lock at all. The two cases differ in
#          exactly one place: repair ownership. A locked session is told to
#          restore a tangled primary checkout itself, while an unlocked one is
#          told to leave that work to the lock holder. Unset/0 (the default)
#          keeps detect-only meaning unlocked, exactly as before.
#        fm-bootstrap.sh install <tool>...
#          Install the named tools (only ones the captain approved).
